# apsc-200

This code is from the APSC 200 P2 project, which we called the HoldSmart Medical Edition

The product is meant to remind useres to take their medication on time
This is done by using a force sensor to detect the presnece or absesnce of mecidation
If medication is still on the force sensor at the user-inputted reminder time, a message is sent to the Bluetooth Module
The Bluetooth Serial Terminal App was used to display the messages
A red LD also turns on when the medication needs to tbe taken
